This BlogPost is more about updates on whats going on in my life.

I deleted all Social media applications from my phone. from that I saw my productivity soar, and my anxiety decrees significantly. Also, the world didn't end.

I studied some Redux, it is cool but the challenge with redux in its abstract form for me it seems to complex to accomplish the simple task.

As I understand its a tool for really `complex` applications.

So I decided to switch direction and studying React Native with Redux. The great thing about that:
1. it gives it context
2. Increasing the learning
3. It's closer to real life. (I checked with my friends that work in dev shops)

I also jumped on the Udemy bandwagon. As a strong visual learner. This has given my learning structure, path, outcome and focus. funny sometimes there is Advice you receive and not understand it at the time.

The host of the Boston Ruby Group: Project Night told me there is value in courses that are paid, as much that free tutorials online are cool & useful yet they dont dive into the why you do certain things so you can level up as a developer/ programmer.

This week I will be giving my first lighting talk at the Boston Ruby group: Project Night meetup. The topic will be Hello World demo using the server-less framework  to build an endpoint on the AWS infrastructure.  I am very grateful for the privilege.

Also at the end of the week I will be for the first time TAing (teacher assistant) at Boston's RailsBridge Event where under-served communities (Female, color and LGTBQ)learn how to build an application in rails in a day and half.
