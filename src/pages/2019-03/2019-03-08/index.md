>â€œTake advantage of every opportunity to practice your communication skills so that when important occasions arise, you will have the gift, the style, the sharpness, the clarity, and the emotions to affect other people" - Jim Rohn

### Why would you blog when no one reads this blog?

I believe in this quote because I got my start in the real estate business, and I saw a lot of agent with a seemingly low natural skill in terms of communication practice until they looked like a professional in no time.
So I decided to the same when it came to working with buyers. I kept practicing the presentation until I got good at it.
To the point, I got my close rate up to  75% from 25%. The odds were if we had a meeting about home buying we would work together.

I am not saying this to brag, but it shows that practice shows results.

So I am looking to be much better at writing, communicating because one of the keys things in programming is learning to communicate at a high level so you can advocate for your self, team, and company.

Look for a blog post every day.
