>“The best TDD can do, is assure that code does what the programmer thinks it should do. That is pretty good BTW.” – James Grenning

So started doing something considered to be a thought exercise by most programmers.
TDD AKA Test Driven Development

If you didn't know [ThoughtBot](https://thoughtbot.com/) one of the leading agencies in the US has started releasing a lot of their teaching materials for free. That is a treasure trove for any new developer, and there is [material](https://thoughtbot.com/learn) there on how they design, develop and test code. Which is for a lot of programmers is like getting access to the chocolate factory.

I decided to early on in my career to learn how to build something as complex as A full Rails application Using TDD. If you want to follow along with the [repo](https://github.com/nadermokhtar/raddat), It is a Reddit clone, not fancy. Just shipped the first feature of the application. Now I can link and see it. Yay.

Note: if your reading the code I am calling the links as hookups to avoid confusion when reading errors.

So look for more articles on my learning from this exercise.
