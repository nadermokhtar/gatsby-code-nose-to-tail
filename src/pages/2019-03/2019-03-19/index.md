Are you a full stack Developer? AKA are you a mini CTO? Full stack is a new term (say five years old) why did this term evolve? And from where?

These are interesting concepts, in the past, it was okay to know one language only now the market has shifted, and Most Software engineers need to know javascript for the front end, and if they are lucky, the whole stack would be in javascript like: React plus node/express. Now, most engineers know Javascript for the front end and rails/PHP/Django and for those new age kids Elixir/Phoenix on top of that if your building complex business logic you got to implement C#/Java/Go/rust. On top of that don't mention databases, styling and server technologies.

You may say this sound like a rant, what does that all mean?

Polyglot need to be in your resume, you need to pick a side project a year to learn a new language.

My advice is to learn Redux in Javascript.

Why?
1. Redux is a killer tool now being used with the most famous library in javascript React.js
2. Helps make React.js much more potent by managing state and removing the limitation of passing data around.
3. Little know fact Redux is a functional library, so its a simple entry for most web developers to learn functional programming.
4. Functional programming is the future, and it produces more reliable code and easier to maintain long term.

Back to the main point, you need to have a grasp of the whole stack before lots of companies start abstracting a lot of things we as programmers do. Evident with things like the JAM Stack where a developer can essentially build a business using a black box called Saas or Faas.

When you need to build a custom thing for your business or your business needs to grow, the developers will say I don't know how.


It is not Doom and Gloom. Its just craft that might get forgotten and soon as it hits the mainstream.

Note older programmers tell me everything is a fad, and as fast things change in trends yet principles stay the same.

I digress.
