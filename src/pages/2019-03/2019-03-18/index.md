>“I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.” ― Kent Beck

I found love in TDD, and I think TDD will be my battle cry from now on. Why? TDD is an excellent habit that programmers can implement today no matter the skill level. And feel right about the quality of the code. For newbies, it might not be elegant at first, but with time you can learn more and more.

TDD is a 4x multiplier because you learn four things at the same time:

1. You learn to sudo code well because you need to translate prompts/business requirements into good tests otherwise you will have to refactor your tests too many times.

2. If you have broken down the problem well enough from sudo codding you will be able to write great tests.

3. TDD allows you to be able to explain how you came to that conclusion because the tests are self-documenting.

4. TDD teaches how to be a better programmer by forcing you not to over program and not have spaghetti code.

So I recommend you explore TDD in your language of choice as a programmer slowly you will become 4x better.
