##Gatsby the power of plug and play:


So I wanted to learn Gatsby to know whats Static Site generators.
  * So far it has been a breeze.
  * Actually a Spring breeze.
  * There is a few conventions to follow and you will be up and ready in no time.

Start your own use this button(This will deploy to Netlify and your GitHub with a continuos deployment setup):

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)

Then watch this series of videos that go into detail on how the files are structured.

And by video 4 should be up and running with a gatsby Blog.

After this you should be able to edit you picture, bio and make your first posts and rock an roll.

Future plans is to make this blog into a separate entity contained in my personal website but this will do for now.
