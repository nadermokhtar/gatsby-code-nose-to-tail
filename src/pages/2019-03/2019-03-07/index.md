### So what is a long time?
### I hear from a lot of people `patience`.
### What does that look like?
I struggle with these concepts when your an oddball of sorts — never finding a pace or cadence. In life I have been a fantastic sprinter. I sprinted in three years to have my home built. I sprinted for a year to help sort out family affairs. Went from never have dated to within a year in a long term relationship than another year married.

I found my calling in code. I am certain. Because I can study/ code or talk about it for 8 hours in a row and not get bored.

## In the past, I have been through many transformations:
* Introvert to an extrovert.
* Fat kid to running half marathons.
###Now I am pushing my self on the next one is going from some with excuses to someone with results:
#### Look for the Phoenix near you

Tools I am using for:
* Blogging
* Coding
* Teach code as I learn
* Running regularly
* practicing vanulnrablity
