###Day 15 of the hunt,

We went into this wilderness 15 days ago, and we already lost 5-6 crew members to JOBS...

So since graduating from the Wonderful coding Bootcamp experience two weeks ago, it has been an exciting roller coaster of emotions

I had great experience in interviews so far and getting the no at the end of the process has been like a stab in the heart.

There is a point here to all this joking around. As coders we have to get comfortable with the red. Yes, the red of errors as we were running code regularly we would see a lot of red, and that was an opportunity to learn and grow and make better code. You cant see the green unless you struggle through a lot of red.

It is core to a fundamental principle we learned which is TDD (Test Driven Development).

RED, GREEN, REFACTOR
The red, green, refactor approach helps developers compartmentalize their focus into three phases:

>Red — think about what you want to develop

>Green — think about how to make your tests pass

>Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

So I am taking this approach to my job hunting and carrying this to beyond.

I am trying to gather as much feedback from the employer that have passed on me. So I can make these test pass in the future and refactor to come off as a stronger candidate.
