#DO, Do, Do

There are two people in life â€” ones that do and ones that talk. One is not better than the other.

But there is a third option talk after you have done. Show your trophy's or scar's.

I try to keep my post in that third way. I made a gatsby blog and talked about it. So Today I have things to finish so I can talk about them tomorrow.

##Advice I got yesterday
>Balance is learning the new with getting better at the old.

Have a wonderful day.
