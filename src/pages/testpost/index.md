So .....

I always have a hunger to learn.

I cant explain it.
When I am learning I am happy.
When I am not learning I feel lost.

##So decided to build my blog in gatsby js to learn a few things :

* Static site generation
* Gatsby
* Graph QL
* CSS in js
* Auto Deployment from gitHub to Netlify

So look for new posts soon about all these topics.
