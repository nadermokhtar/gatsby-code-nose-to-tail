As a new developer, it's always a challenge to see correct paths.

I had an opportunity to interview with a company that is looking to get free work from novice programmers.

It was an unpleasant experience when I figured it out.

I am grateful for the experience. I heard about these situations, and now I know what these situations are when I see them.

My current goal now its too keep my coding momentum. Also, getting the momentum rolling on interviews.
