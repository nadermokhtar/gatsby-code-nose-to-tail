### My graduation project was such a cool concept to me.

I wanted to create the digital version of the bullet journal.

A simple, dynamic, customizable, journal that allows you to rapidly log tasks events and notes assigning priority and time to them.

Sadly it was incomplete by the time graduation came, so it was good enough to do some of the things I had in mind and enabled me to present for graduation.

And this was the result: [LaunchCodex](http://cryptic-atoll-41436.herokuapp.com/)

But at the time it was a personal sign of defeat that it was so incomplete. I have reasons why but that doesn't serve anything.

So after graduation, I wanted to focus on job hunting, and I put my identity into that, and when I didn't get a job right away, I got down on my self. (I know its ridiculous to have had that expectation right away)

Having forgotten why I got into programming in the first place.

>The joy and magic of building things.

I saw one of my friends working on a similar project and having fun working through it.

So now I decided to brush the dust off my idea and rebuilding it from scratch, so I can enjoy the coding once more reach out to my friend that working on the similar project to collaborate on the know-how of certain features that overlap.

###So you might ask why I am talking about this here?

This project other than being a passion project of mine is an excellent demo of CRUD (create, read, update and destroy).

Will this demo win any awards not likely. But it is an excellent project for me to learn and relearn a variety of frameworks in the future (back to my core passion).

I will keep posting my progress about LaunchCodex it among my other topics.
